it shouldn't occur that an object's max and min are outside it's bounds
if it does that means the tree node is empty and should be un-subdivided

(though it maybe cannot be un subdivided, because there are objects in the adjacent
sub nodes)


if subdividing doesn't reduce the number of objects in the sub divisions
then return that the object wasn't added and remove the created sub nodes


need to return the number of new leaves created on an addObject and the amount of depth added
